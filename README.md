# h5ai-themes

These icon themes were previously shipped with [h5ai][h5ai]. Put these theme
folders into folder `_h5ai/client/themes` of your h5ai installation, so that
the file structure will be `_h5ai/client/themes/<theme-name>/icons/<type>.<ext>`.

To select a theme use the option `view > theme` in file `_h5ai/conf/options.json`.

Currently there are two themes included:

* `evolvere` based on [Evolvere&nbsp;Icon&nbsp;Theme][evolvere]&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)
* `faenza` based on [Faenza&nbsp;Icons][faenza]&nbsp;(GPL)
